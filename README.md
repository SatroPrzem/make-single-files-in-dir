#make-single-files-in-dir

The script helps to move individual files into folders with the same name but without an extension.

You can just copy this script to a direcy or run with 1 or arg.

1st arg is a directory

2nd arg is the extension name

This is an destructive operation so be careful where you run it.

eg. default current folder and all extnames

node make-single-files-in-dir.js

or

make-single-files-in-dir.js ../my-path/test .txt

(path is relative to the script location)
