#make-single-files-in-dir

The script helps to move individual files into folders with the same name but without an extension.

You can just copy this script to a direcy or run with args.

1st arg is the extension name

2nd arg is a directory: default ./

This is an destructive operation so be careful where you run it.

eg. default current folder and all extnames

node make-single-files-in-dir.js

or

make-single-files-in-dir.js .txt ../my-path/test
